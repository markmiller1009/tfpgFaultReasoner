Scenario Logic: "The Silent Hypoxia Trap"

This scenario represents a "Double Fault" condition—a nightmare scenario for safety analysis—where a primary component fails, and the backup system is simultaneously compromised.

1. Fault 1 (t=2000ms): Regulator_Stuck_Closed (FM3).
    ◦ Effect: The main plenum pressure drops rapidly.
    ◦ Discrepancy: D3 (Low Plenum Pressure) activates.
    ◦ Prognosis: The system will predict Total_Asphyxia_Risk (D6) but will stall because the AND-gate requires the backup system (D5) to fail as well. This creates a Latent Risk state.
2. Fault 2 (t=6000ms): BOS_Leak (FM4).
    ◦ Context: The pilot attempts to engage the Backup Oxygen Supply (BOS), but the cylinder is empty/leaking.
    ◦ Effect: BOS pressure drops below the usable threshold.
    ◦ Discrepancy: D5 (BOS Depleted) activates.
3. Critical Event (t=7500ms): Total_Asphyxia_Risk (D6).
    ◦ Logic: D3 (Main Fail) AND D5 (Backup Fail) are now both valid. The propagation delays satisfy the edges, triggering the Level 10 event.

What makes this realistic?
1. Temporal Decoupling: The two failures happen 4 seconds apart. Real-world accidents are often chains of events where a primary failure (Regulator) exposes a dormant secondary failure (BOS Leak).
2. AND-Gate Verification: This explicitly tests your LogicEngine's ability to hold D6 inactive despite D3 being active for over 5 seconds (exceeding its edge max of 5s). D6 only activates once the second path (D5) satisfies its temporal constraint.
3. Signal Noise: The O2 concentration drops to 90.0% at t=4000ms. This technically triggers D1 (Low O2 < 93%), adding a "distractor" discrepancy that has lower criticality (Level 5) than the pending Level 10 event. Your Hypothesis Ranking should prioritize the hypothesis that explains both D3 and D1, and eventually D5.
